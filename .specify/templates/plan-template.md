# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] Module and layer impact is explicit (`booking`: `infrastructure -> application -> domain`; `seedwork`: `infrastructure -> domain -> core`); domain layer contains only Entity/Event/ValueObject types, @Service domain services, ProblemException subclasses, and interfaces.
- [ ] Domain changes keep business rules in domain types; new aggregates raise creation events in the constructor; `equals()`/`hashCode()` use domain identity, not surrogate key; `private Long id` and `protected` no-arg constructor are at the bottom of each aggregate class.
- [ ] Required automated tests are identified for every touched layer, including ArchUnit when structure changes.
- [ ] OpenAPI specs, Flyway migrations, domain ORM XMLs (`META-INF/domain/`), query projection ORM XMLs (`META-INF/query/`), and generated interfaces are accounted for when contracts or persistence change; ORM resources are explicitly listed in `spring.jpa.mapping-resources`.
- [ ] Performance budget is documented, including endpoint/query latency target, bounded result expectations, and any N+1 or chatty-call risks.
- [ ] All precondition checks use `Contract.require()` and all invariant checks use `Contract.check()`; domain exceptions extend `ProblemException` with `<STATE>_PROBLEM` constants; `notFound()` uses `Problem.notFound()` (HTTP 404), state violations use `Problem.conflict()` (HTTP 409); idempotent state transitions use an early-return guard after the `Contract.check()`.
- [ ] Naming follows layer conventions: noun accessors and `is<State>()` predicates in domain; `<verb><Noun>(<Command>)` in command handlers; `get<Entity>` / `list<Entities>` / `search<Entities>` in query handlers; `on<EventType>` in event handlers; `<Noun>DetailView` / `<Noun>SummaryView` for view projections; `to<TargetType>()` in `@Component` mappers; `<method>With<State>Should<Behavior>()` in tests; `<Aggregate>Fixture` factory methods in test fixtures; REST controllers implement `<Domain>Operations` and return 201/204/200.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
